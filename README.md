# Rock_Paper_Scissors_game

   ### a hand game usually played between two people. The type of game originated in China and spread with increased contact with East Asia, while developing different variants in signs over time.

## Instructions:

###  each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
###   These shapes are:

   #### * "rock" (a closed fist),
   #### * "paper" (a flat hand),
   #### * "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.

## Who is the winner?
   
   ### A player who decides to play rock will beat another player who has chosen scissors ("rock crushes scissors" or sometimes "blunts scissors"

   ### but rock will lose to one who has played paper ("paper covers rock"); 
    
   ### a play of paper will lose to a play of scissors ("scissors cuts paper").
    
   ### If both players choose the same shape, the game is tied and is usually immediately replayed to break the tie.
