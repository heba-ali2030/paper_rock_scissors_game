# Rock_Paper_Scissors_game

   ### a hand game usually played between two people

## Instructions:

###  each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
###   These shapes are:

   #### * "rock" (a closed fist),
   #### * "paper" (a flat hand),
   #### * "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). "Scissors" is identical to the two-fingered V sign (also indicating "victory" or "peace") except that it is pointed horizontally instead of being held upright in the air.
